## AdventOfCode2021
A series of challenges in the spirit of the holidays üéÑ

All of these solutions will be written in Python with the following goals in mind:
1. __Efficiency,__ where an efficient algorithm will do the job without over-killing the problem. I am aiming for a cumulative sub-15 seconds using plain Python 3.9 (no PyPy or JIT compilers) for these tasks.
2. __Organization.__ Avoid duplicate code for better readability and modularity. No üçù code!
3. __Keep it simple!__

This year, I'd like to focus more on staying on the leaderboard similar to my 2020 results. 
It will definitely be more challenging this year given the number of participants :)

__Current score:__ 58 points

__Total runtime:__ 2 milliseconds


## Thought Recollection

- Day 1: Could've gotten < 1 minute on Part 1 but didn't take account the first number; off to a great start.

- Day 2: The fact that `1:25` was rank 43 meant that there are a lot more competitors this year ;-; I'm glad that I'm still decent enough to score some points though.
