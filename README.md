## AdventOfCode2021
A series of challenges in the spirit of the holidays 🎄

All of these solutions will be written in Python with the following goals in mind:
1. __Efficiency,__ where an efficient algorithm will do the job without over-killing the problem. I am aiming for a cumulative sub-15 seconds using plain Python 3.9 (no PyPy or JIT compilers) for these tasks.
2. __Organization.__ Avoid duplicate code for better readability and modularity. No 🍝 code!
3. __Keep it simple!__

This year, I'd like to focus more on staying on the leaderboard similar to my 2020 results. 
It will definitely be more challenging this year given the number of participants :)

## Final Thoughts 

Overall I did better than last year and achieved some pretty good ranks on a few days. I'm pretty stoked about my performance this year, but the lack of sleep + exams kind of killed my mood a bit :c 

Excited that I got top 40th overall this time, and looking forward to Advent of Code 2022!
