## AdventOfCode2021
A series of challenges in the spirit of the holidays üéÑ

All of these solutions will be written in Python with the following goals in mind:
1. __Efficiency,__ where an efficient algorithm will do the job without over-killing the problem. I am aiming for a cumulative sub-15 seconds using plain Python 3.9 (no PyPy or JIT compilers) for these tasks.
2. __Organization.__ Avoid duplicate code for better readability and modularity. No üçù code!
3. __Keep it simple!__

This year, I'd like to focus more on staying on the leaderboard similar to my 2020 results. 
It will definitely be more challenging this year given the number of participants :)

**Note:** Will be posting my solutions slightly later for the next few days due to exams

__Current score:__ 1089 points

__Total runtime:__ 1205 milliseconds


## Thought Recollection

- Day 1: Could've gotten < 1 minute on Part 1 but didn't take account the first number; off to a great start.

- Day 2: The fact that `1:25` was rank 43 meant that there are a lot more competitors this year ;-; I'm glad that I'm still decent enough to score some points though.

- Day 3: Rough day, had a lot of comparison bugs on both parts. With the current difficulty curve it seems like this year's challenges will be a lot more difficult...

- Day 4: Finally got a good amount of points today, and I can finally see myself on the global leaderboard now.

- Day 5: First time I hit the single digits! Despite the bugs I had in part 2 I'm quite happy about my performance today.

- Day 6: Spent too much time trying to understand the problem unfortunately, and ran into a time-consuming bug for part 2. Maybe tomorrow will be better.

- Day 7: Slightly better, but too many competitive people this year meant that a < 2 min part 1 was required for top 100.

- Day 8: Completely blanked out on Part 2, did not realize that a permutation search would've worked :S

- Day 9: Nothing notable, but I got some points which I can't complain.

- Day 10: Accidentally fell asleep and woke up 15 minutes late. All my private leaderboard positions are ruined :D

- Day 11: Got some points despite being sleep deprived and dealing for finals. Can't complain! 

- Day 12: I'm starting to believe that this year's theme is graph theory. Also secured a position in the top 100 leaderboard by reaching 700 points!

- Day 13: Nothing notable.

- Day 14: Enjoyed today's task, found a few observations that would simplify my solution while I was writing Part 2.

- Day 15: Passed part 1 by only considering moving right and down; got tricked in part 2 immediately. Eigth place for part 1 is pretty cool though.
