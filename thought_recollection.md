## Thought Recollection

- Day 1: Could've gotten < 1 minute on Part 1 but didn't take account the first number; off to a great start.

- Day 2: The fact that `1:25` was rank 43 meant that there are a lot more competitors this year ;-; I'm glad that I'm still decent enough to score some points though.

- Day 3: Rough day, had a lot of comparison bugs on both parts. With the current difficulty curve it seems like this year's challenges will be a lot more difficult...

- Day 4: Finally got a good amount of points today, and I can finally see myself on the global leaderboard now.

- Day 5: First time I hit the single digits! Despite the bugs I had in part 2 I'm quite happy about my performance today.

- Day 6: Spent too much time trying to understand the problem unfortunately, and ran into a time-consuming bug for part 2. Maybe tomorrow will be better.

- Day 7: Slightly better, but too many competitive people this year meant that a < 2 min part 1 was required for top 100.

- Day 8: Completely blanked out on Part 2, did not realize that a permutation search would've worked :S

- Day 9: Nothing notable, but I got some points which I can't complain.

- Day 10: Accidentally fell asleep and woke up 15 minutes late. All my private leaderboard positions are ruined :D

- Day 11: Got some points despite being sleep deprived and dealing for finals. Can't complain! 

- Day 12: I'm starting to believe that this year's theme is graph theory. Also secured a position in the top 100 leaderboard by reaching 700 points!

- Day 13: Nothing notable.

- Day 14: Enjoyed today's task, found a few observations that would simplify my solution while I was writing Part 2.

- Day 15: Passed part 1 by only considering moving right and down; got tricked in part 2 immediately. Eigth place for part 1 is pretty cool though.

- Day 16: Can't read instructions fast enough :(

- Day 17: Blundered a lot, including but not limited to solving the wrong problem and setting the wrong range for the velocities.

- Day 18: I have nightmares from snailfish.

- Day 19: Interesting problem, unfortunately lost 30 minutes from a one line error.

- Day 20: Cool twist of the cellular automaton problems :)

- Day 21: Finally broke my streak and got some points on the leaderboard :) 

- Day 22: My solution takes a good minute to run even with pypy, not looking forward to optimizing it :) [Update: I optimized it.]

- Day 23: I was hoping this would be easy so that I could sleep in... Ended up staying a few hours later.

- Day 24: Happy to see a reverse engineering task :p 

- Day 25: Nothing eventful, I was just too slow.
